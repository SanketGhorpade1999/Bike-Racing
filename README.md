# Bike-Racing
The Bike Race Game in C++ is a console application game development project. It is interesting, simple to play and demonstrates the use of various features of C++ programming language and SDL. In order to enhance the aesthetic of the game, I have utilized the application of graphics in the game to make the game more realistic.
